I'm a front-end developer who likes to create beautiful websites with a great user experience. I can turn a design into a real working website with responsive design.<br /><br />

I enjoy creating beautiful websites because it feels like an accomplishment to complete one.<br /><br />

I graduated from Universiti Utara Malaysia with a degree in bachelor of science (multimedia).<br /><br />

I am a positive thinker, and I think this helps me the most in difficult moments.
